 Java shell scripting. Project goals...
 1 Easy to execute. No compilation needed.
 2 Easy file manipulation.
 3 Easy to use external java libraries.
 4 Easy to install.


This is was experimental project. I wanted to use Java for scripting the way I use Perl or Python.

Bullet point 2 - Was improved by Java 7 with the introduction of the new java.nio.* standard library.

Bullet points 1 and 3 - Were possibly improved/solved by spring Boot.

I would like to take a fresh look at this and see where it fits now that we have Spring Boot. I still think the idea of using a sha1 to determine if the source needs to be recompiled has some merit. It gives the apperance that Java is an interpetive language.
